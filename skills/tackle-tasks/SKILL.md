- blocked status: !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checkBlockers.ts" '$ARGUMENTS[0]'`
- task details (unblocked tasks only): !`u=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checkBlockers.ts" --unblocked '$ARGUMENTS[0]'); [ -n "$u" ] && node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/getTaskDetails.ts" "$u" || echo "none of the requested tasks are unblocked"`
- pipeline args: !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prepareTasks.ts" '$ARGUMENTS[0]'`

Do not work on any task reported as BLOCKED in the "blocked status" above — report its open blockers and move on to the next requested task that is unblocked.

Invoke `/ponytail:ponytail ultra`.

Call Workflow with scriptPath "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/tackle-tasks/tackle-tasks.workflow.js"
and args set to the pipeline args JSON printed above, verbatim.

Present merged, conflicts, needsClarification and blocked to the user. Ask every
needsClarification question with AskUserQuestion. ONLY after the user approves, invoke
close-tasks once for all merged tasks.

There is no serial fallback path. One task or ten, the same code path runs.

## Verification

Review the task details above (each object comes from `tasks.json` if the task is open, or `completedTasks.json` if it was already completed). Cross-reference the task with the codebase to determine if the task is still relevant or if it has been resolved.
Use the git history and recent commits (over the last 3 days) to confirm/deny the existence of the unblocked tasks detailed above.

## Closing your tasks

Close every task that is not problematic and was completed successfully, rendering its `tasks.json` entry stale, with **one** invocation of the `close-tasks` skill for all of them. Its first argument must be a JSON array of the task numbers with no spaces — `[268,270,281]` — followed by your reasoning for the `closureNote`s, naming each task (`#268 …, #270 …`) when the reasons differ.

If the user requests adding tasks, invoke the `create-task` skill once per task — never edit `tasks.json` directly.

During implementation, run typecheck only — no test suites or visual checks, by you or by workers. Full verification (typecheck + full suite + the repo's UI verification where relevant) runs once inside `close-tasks`, after the user approves closing.

## Commit message

Finally, follow these instructions:

!`cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/tackle-tasks/COMMIT_MESSAGES.md"`
