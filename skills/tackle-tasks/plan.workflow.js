Read this brief file: ${t.briefFile}
You may also READ these owned files, and nothing else: ${t.files.join(', ')}
Read them — a plan that guesses at their contents will be rejected by the reviewer.
Follow ~/.claude/guides/planning.md and write the plan to exactly this path: ${t.planFile}
Do not change any source file — this is planning only, not implementation.

The plan must be exact enough that the implementer makes no discovery of its own:
- Name every edit by file path and line number, with the current text and what it becomes.
- Account for every owned file: either its exact edit list, or the reason it needs no edit.
- Resolve every question while planning. Write no conditional instruction — no
  "re-check", no "verify before editing", no "if the live file disagrees", no
  "trust the live file". If you could not settle something, that is
  needs-clarification, not a fallback sentence in the plan.
- Quote only text you actually read. Never describe an excerpt the brief does not contain.
- State the verification that proves the change worked, as commands with expected results.

If the plan would need to edit a file outside the owned list above, set status
"needs-clarification" and name that file in "question" — do not plan the edit anyway.
If the task is unclear, set status "needs-clarification" and put your
question in "question". If the task no longer applies to the codebase, set
status "not-relevant" and explain why in "question". Otherwise write the
plan file and set status "planned".
Return {task: ${t.number}, status, planFile: "${t.planFile}", question}.

You are forbidden to edit any file other than ${t.planFile}; to read a file outside
the owned list; to leave a decision for the implementer; or to write a plan step
whose exact target you did not read.`
