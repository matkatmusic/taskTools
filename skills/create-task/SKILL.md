name: create-task
description: the ONLY way to add a task to tasks.json. ALWAYS invoke this skill whenever any task is being added — whether it comes from the user, from another skill, or from your own work — never edit tasks.json directly. Use discernment — if $ARGUMENTS explains the task well enough, write it directly; if not, refine it with AskUserQuestion (or /grill-me for direction-setting tasks) first.
argument-hint: "<task description>"

- taskNumber to use: !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/nextTaskNumber.ts"`

Task described by the user: $ARGUMENTS

Decide whether that description is actionable later without this conversation's context: a concrete goal or symptom, plus file paths / repro steps / URLs where applicable. If it is, proceed. If not, invoke AskUserQuestion to fill the specific gaps; for a large or direction-setting task, invoke `/grill-me` instead to refine it.

Append ONE object to the `tasks.json` array as its LAST element — at the very end of the array, after every existing entry. Never insert it in the middle and never reorder or renumber the existing entries. Use this template:

```json
!`cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/create-task/template/taskTemplate.json"`
```

Populate `files` with the repo-relative paths the task will touch, including test files. If they genuinely cannot be determined, omit the field entirely rather than guessing.

If the request names the source note/handoff file(s) the task came from (e.g. an `update-tasks` harvest), also include `"handoffFilePaths": [<those repo-relative paths>]` in the object; otherwise omit the field.

If `specs/SPEC.md` exists and this task belongs to one of its spec items, append the task number to that item's `Tasks:` line.

Omit completion-related fields (`completionDate`, `commitHashes`, `closureNote`) — those belong to `completedTasks.json`, which this skill never touches.

Finally, confirm to the user: the task number and title that were added.
